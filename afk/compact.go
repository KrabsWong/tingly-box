// conversation itself and returns a compaction block in the response. We keep
// sending the full history — the block is what tells the API which part of it to
// replace on the next request — so nothing here rewrites or drops messages.
//
// This is the whole mechanism. There is no in-process summarizer: doing it
// ourselves meant an extra model call per compaction, a summary written by a
// prompt we maintain, and a boundary-selection rule that had to avoid cutting a
// tool_result away from its tool_use. All of that is the platform's job.
